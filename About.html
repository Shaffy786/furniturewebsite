                 <p>We know a thing or two about sofas. That's because we enjoy producing high quality, comfy and stylish items, many right here in the UK. We already have decades of experience and expertise, which means that today we're proud to bring you a different range of beds and chairs, along with unbeatable quality, and service that's second to none.
            Wherever you place your order with FurnitureIsland, all products made to customers' specifications are on sale at the same price in every store and on-line. FurnitureIsland products are always at their normal price for at least as long as they are at a special offer price.
                </p>
               
                <p>Once you've chosen your sofa, our time-served upholsterers will handcraft it to order for you. With three of our own UK factories we employ skilled upholsterers and craftspeople, who genuinely care about the quality and comfort of your sofa as much as you do. Our experience in making sofas to the highest quality standards mean you can be sure you'll love your sofa now and for many years to come. In fact, we're so confident in our quality that we're delighted to give you a 15 year guarantee as standard.
                 When your new sofa is ready, our installation team will carefully deliver it to the room of your choice and take away all the packaging.
